### Bean
When you mark a class with annotations like @Component or @Service, or define a method with @Bean in a configuration class, you're telling Spring, "Hey, this is a special object that you should take care of." Spring will then create an instance of this class and keep it ready for use in its application context, which is like a big pool of beans (objects).
